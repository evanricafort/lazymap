# lazymap

Lazymap is a single command-line tool made for network penetration testing. It combines multiple selected NMAP scripts, sslscan, ssh-audit, dig, ldapsearch, curl, rpcclient, selected metasploit modules, and wget.

# Additional Information
# v0.5

* Added sslscan for additional POC for ssl-related issues.
* Added ssh-audit for additional POC for ssh-related issues.
* Added 2 Metasploit modules to scan RDP and RPC issues.
* Merged my 2nd personal project, **CheckThatHeaders**, which scans and detects missing HTTP security header issues.
* Added a feature to determine if the target is within the subnet or individual IP to relay the result without issue for sslscan, ssh-audit and checkthatheaders.
* Added a not so fancy ascii art for the banner.
* Improved verbose and scan outputs.

# v0.6

* Added another metasploit module for Oracle TNS SID Enumeration.
* Added 'dig' for DNSSec vulnerability scan.
* Added 'ldapsearch' for LDAP Anonymous Bind scan.
* Added 'rpcclient' for Unauthenticated RPC scan.
* Added 'curl' for Default IIS Webpage detection.
* Re-configured 'checkthatheaders' to scan live host (Port 80, 443, 8443, 8080) only.
* Added -k flag to exclude sslscan, ssh-audit, and CheckThatHeaders scans.
* Added -a flag to exclude the all ports scan and UDP scan.
* Added -N flag to add -n -T4 to Nmap command for faster scanning.
* Added -h flag to display this help message.
* Added a feature to combine multiple flags.
* Improved verbose and scan outputs.

# Usage

- Usage: ./lazymap.sh -u host _[Single Host]_ or ./lazymap.sh -t hosts.txt _[Multiple Hosts]_
- Additional Options: Insert additional scripts with option **-1** for _[vulners]_, **-2** for _[vuln]_, **-3** for both _[vulners & vuln]_ NSE scripts, **-4** for Firewall Evasion Scan, **-a** exclude the all ports scan and UDP scan, **-N** to add -n -T4 to Nmap command for faster scanning and **-k** to exclude sslscan, ssh-audit, and CheckThatHeaders scans.
- Reminder: Option **-3** may take some time to finish if you have multiple targets.
- Note: Run in sudo mode to execute NMAP scripts related to UDP scan.
